    <p>To prepare jollof rice, Nigerian Jollof rice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken, beef, etc</li>
        <li>3 cups rice</li>
        <li>6-9 cups stock + water</li>
        <li>1 cup + 2 tablespoons Tomato stew base</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons tomato paste </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves </li>
        <li>3 seasoning cubes salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger powder (optional) </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season and boil chicken or beef until tender, drain (set aside the stock) and fry or grill. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Wash rice in several changes of water till water is almost clear. Leave in a bowl of water and set aside. (There has been an ongoing debate whether this stage actually helps with the texture of the finished dish, it works for me)</li>
        <li>Strain your stock through a fine sieve and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a dry pot put the tomato stew base and tomato paste and fry for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add stock, water, curry powder, thyme and seasoning cubes. Bring to a boil over medium-high flame.</li>
        <li>Taste and add salt.</li>
        <li>Drain and add the rice, stir and bring back to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover tightly.</li>
        <li>When there is very little liquid remaining, reduce heat further and cook till quite dry. If the rice is not soft enough, sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of water over it and keep steaming.</li>
        <li>Take off the heat and leave covered for about 5-10 minutes to absorb the last bit of moisture and dry out.</li>
        <li>Stir and serve.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
